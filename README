hdhrsteam

A simple relay that repackages data received through the libhdhomerun
library and forwards it as a UDP stream to a specific destination.

Usage example:

hdhrstream auto:7 192.168.0.1

Tunes HDHomerun to channel 7 and begins streaming UDP data to the host
at 192.168.0.1 on port 5000 (default)

hdhrstream auto:7 192.168.0.1 3000

Same as before except to port 3000, overriding default.
